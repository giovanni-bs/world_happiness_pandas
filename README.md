# world_happiness_pandas

This is a quick analysis on the World Happiness Report dataset, available on: https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness.
In this Python notebook, we are using Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotLib and Seaborn libraries to work on the dataset and obtain some important statistics and correlations.
At the end, there is a comparison between Brazil and other big countries such as USA, UK and Canada, regarding the happiness attributes and scores.
The text descriptions are written in Brazilian Portuguese (PT-BR).
